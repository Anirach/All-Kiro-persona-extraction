## Methodological Framework

### Evidence-Based Extraction Methodology

#### Core Principles
1. **Evidence Primacy**: All claims must be grounded in explicit evidence units
2. **Traceability**: Complete chain of provenance from source to claim
3. **Transparency**: All reasoning and confidence factors must be explainable
4. **Reproducibility**: Identical inputs must produce identical outputs
5. **Human Oversight**: Critical decisions require human validation

#### Extraction Pipeline

```
┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐
│   Source    │───▶│  Evidence   │───▶│    Claim    │
│ Collection  │    │ Unitization │    │ Extraction  │

       │                   │                   │
       ▼                   ▼                   ▼
┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐

│ Assessment  │    │ Extraction  │    │ Validation  │
└─────────────┘    └─────────────┘    └─────────────┘
```

#### Evidence Unit Definition
**Structure:**
- **Text Segment**: 200-400 character snippets with natural boundaries
- **Source Context**: URL, domain, publication date, authority metrics
- **Topic Candidates**: Extracted keywords and themes
- **Quality Score**: Multi-factor reliability assessment
- **Provenance Chain**: Complete audit trail

**Quality Criteria:**
- **Relevance**: Direct relationship to persona characteristics
- **Specificity**: Contains concrete, actionable information
- **Recency**: Publication date relative to query timeframe
- **Authority**: Source credibility and expertise
- **Completeness**: Sufficient context for interpretation

### Source Tiering Methodology

#### Tier 1: Canonical/Official Sources
- **Definition**: Authoritative sources with direct relationship to subject
- **Examples**: Official biographies, interviews, company profiles
- **Quality Indicators**: 
  - Direct quotes or statements
  - First-person accounts
  - Official organizational endorsement
- **Weight Factor**: 1.0

#### Tier 2: Reputable Secondary Sources
- **Definition**: Established media and reference sources
- **Examples**: Major news outlets, academic publications, Wikipedia
- **Quality Indicators**:
  - Editorial oversight
  - Citation of primary sources
  - Established reputation
- **Weight Factor**: 0.8

#### Tier 3: Community/Collaborative Sources
- **Definition**: Crowdsourced but moderated platforms
- **Examples**: Moderated wikis, professional networks
- **Quality Indicators**:
  - Community moderation
  - Multiple contributor validation
  - Transparent editing history
- **Weight Factor**: 0.6

  - Corroboration from higher tiers
- **Weight Factor**: 0.4

### LLM Integration Methodology

#### Prompt Engineering Framework

**Template Structure:**
```
ROLE: [Evidence-based analyst with strict factual constraints]
TASK: [Extract specific persona field with citations]
EVIDENCE: [Numbered evidence units with IDs]
CONSTRAINTS: [Evidence-only, citation requirements, conflict handling]
OUTPUT: [Structured format with confidence and rationale]
```

**Constraint Enforcement:**
- **Evidence-Only Rule**: Explicit prohibition on extrapolation
- **Citation Requirement**: Every sentence must reference evidence ID
- **Conflict Acknowledgment**: Must identify contradictory evidence
- **Confidence Calibration**: Numerical confidence with justification

#### Structured Outputs and Function Calling

- Use JSON Schema to define strict output formats for ClaimField and related types; enable model JSON mode when available.
- Employ function calling to trigger tools for: retrieve(top-k, reranker), validate_citations(ids), deduplicate_units(), and compute_confidence().
- Enforce determinism: set temperature≈0, provide few-shot verified examples, and include schema exemplars.

#### Retrieval Orchestration

- Semantic chunking (200–400 char) with overlap; maintain natural boundaries and metadata.
- Hybrid retrieval: dense embeddings + BM25; add reranking (cross-encoder or service) before LLM.
- Multi-hop retrieval: iterative query reformulation (e.g., HyDE, query decomposition) to capture supporting/contradictory evidence.
- Diversity promotion: domain and source-type balancing to reduce source selection bias.

#### Response Validation Pipeline

1. **Citation Verification**: All referenced evidence IDs must exist
2. **Coverage Analysis**: Ensure all claims are backed by evidence
3. **Conflict Detection**: Identify internal contradictions
4. **Quality Assessment**: Evaluate response completeness and accuracy
5. **Confidence Validation**: Verify confidence scores align with evidence strength
6. **Grounding Checks**: Score responses with AIS/RAGAS; reject below threshold and auto-retry with stricter prompts
7. **Attribution Density**: Enforce minimum citation density per sentence and penalize off-evidence content

#### Safety and Privacy Controls (LLM Stage)

- PII redaction prior to storage/logging; mask personal identifiers not required for claims.
- Safety classifiers (e.g., Llama Guard–style or bespoke) on both inputs and outputs.
- Constitutional prompting to disallow speculation, sensitive attributes, or unsupported assertions.
- Rate limiting and sampled audit logs without PII, aligned with PDPA/GDPR.
